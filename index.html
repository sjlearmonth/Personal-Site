        <h1>Stephen J Learmonth BEng., MSc.</h1>
        <p>Founder and <em>CTO</em> of <strong><a href="https://www.riverstonetechnologies.uk/">Riverstone Technologies UK Ltd</a></strong></p>
        <br>
        <p>Here is a short of bio of myself. I was born in Glasgow in Scotland on the 19th of June 1962 to parents
          John and Patricia Learmonth. I have a younger brother whose name I cannot bring myself to type because
          he is ignorant of other people's feelings. I grew up in Ibrox in Glasgow and attended school there for
          the first time. I later moved to Renfrewshire just outside the centre of Glasgow where I attended primary school. We moved
          house yet again when we moved to Prestwick in Ayrshire where I attended yet another primary school, not
          that my parents cared about all this disruption to my early education.</p>
